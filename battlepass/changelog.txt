# v14 - Major Cacee revert and rework, Jana fixes & tweaks
## Cacee:
	- Removed from the pk3, all future changes are now in caceepass
	- **CACEEPASS v5: THE POT IS BACK O_O**
	 - All the previous changes from BP, plus:
	 - Restored ability to Pot Of Pain (no more tumble, no more 2nd uppercut with AoE wind hitbox)
	 - The Pot Of Pain is now a cactus-type object (not solid, deals spike damage, huggable by Cacee)
	 - Punching objects briefly allows the usage of final punch (still only available after the 2nd punch)
	 - Fixed Cacee's collision wish bashables being extremely inconsistent when trying to punch them
	 - Fixed Cacee being able to cancel the final punch land state depending on addon load order
	 - Hitting bashables with an uppercut prevents Cacee from being able to repeat the move infinitely
	 - Removed aerial special
	 - Removed speed penalty from turning too sharply during a floored punch
	 - Removed ``caceecamera`` restrictions
	 - Removed P_TeleportMove console warnings
	 - Cacee's punch sweetspot leniency is now identical to Amy's melee sweetspot, which basically means:
	  - More consistent collisions (it uses Battle's innate angle-checking functions)
	  - Lower angle leniency (~67.5° -> 45°)
	 - Lowered Cacee's all-around defense to 0 for ALL moves (true no-spin)
	 - Lowered flinch timer of second punch (0.5s -> 0.3s), other punches still have no flinch
## Jana (Thanks JAB and Smol!):
	- (TODO!!) Add JAB's changes to the pk3
	- Fixed Jana's walljump exhaust system only working reliably in singleplayer
	- Sword slash projectiles now inflict tumble for a very short duration instead of damaging
	 - If the player was already in tumble, they get damaged
	- Uh, idk
